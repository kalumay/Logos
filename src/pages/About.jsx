         <center><p>Logos Church is a non denominational church situated in Kalikanagar-12, Butwal. At Logos Church, we firmly believe that the Word of God (Bible) is the ultimate authority in all matters of faith and practice. It is through the Scriptures that we gain true knowledge of God and experience salvation through His grace, received by faith alone. </p>
      <p>We gather every Saturday at 10:30 with the primary goal of worshipping our Almighty God, encouraging one another, and equipping ourselves to live out the Gospel in our daily lives. Our congregation is a beautiful tapestry of diverse backgrounds, embracing multi-ethnicity, varied cultures, and multiple languages. </p>
      <p>At Logos Church, we embrace this invitation and extend it to all who seek refuge and peace. We believe that in Christ, there is rest for the weary, hope for the downtrodden, and healing for the brokenhearted. (Matthew 11:28)</p>
      <p>Come, be a part of Logos Church, where we seek to glorify God alone and live out our faith in unity and love, displaying a glimpse of Heaven on Earth.</p></center>
